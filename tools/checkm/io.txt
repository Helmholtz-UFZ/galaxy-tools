# Some IO information for tool developing: 
# 
# Lineage-specific marker set:
# 
# bins	> 	tree	>	tree_folder
# tree_folder	>	tree_qa		>  
# tree_folder	> 	lineage_set  	> 	marker_file
# 
# Taxonomic-specific marker set:
# 
# 	>	taxon_list   > taxon_list
#	>	taxon_set    > marker_file
# 
# Apply marker set to genome bins:
# 
# bins,marker_file/hmm file	>	analyze      >	analyze_folder
# analyze_folder,marker_file	>	qa   >	(analyze+)qa_folder       
# 
#   Common workflows (combines above commands):
#     lineage_wf   -> Runs tree, lineage_set, analyze, qa
#     taxonomy_wf  -> Runs taxon_set, analyze, qa
# 
# Bin QA plots:
# 
# bins,qa_folder    >	bin_qa_plot	>	
# 
# Reference distribution plots:
# 
# bins	>	gc_plot
# bins,qa_folder	>	coding_plot 
bins,qa_folder,tetra_profile	>	tetra_plot
bins,analyze_folder,tetra_profile	> 	dist_plot

General plots:

# bins	>	nx_plot
# bins	> 	len_plot
# bins	> 	len_hist
# bins,qa_folder	>	marker_plot
    par_plot     <- qa_folder, coverage
    gc_bias_plot <- BAM?

  Sequence subspace plots:
    cov_pca      <- coverage
    tetra_pca    <- tetra_profile

  Bin exploration and modification:
#    unique       <- bins
    merge        <- marker_file/hmms 
    bin_compare  <- sequences, bin1 bin2 

    bin_union    -> [Experimental] Merge multiple binning efforts into a single bin set
    modify       -> [Experimental] Modify sequences in a bin
    outliers     -> [Experimental] Identify outlier in bins relative to reference distributions

  Utility functions:
    unbinned     <- bins, sequences
	-> 
    coverage     <- bins, BAM
	-> coverage
    tetra        <- sequences
		-> tetra
    profile      <- coverage
    join_tables  <- tables? 
    ssu_finder   <- sequences, bins

  Use 'checkm data setRoot' to specify the location of CheckM database files.
