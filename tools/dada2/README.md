TODO
====

In both cases: 

* allow input of single end data, single pair, single pair in separate data sets, ...

If we make a monolithic tool: 

* implement sanity checks between important compute intensive steps (user definable criteria, abort if violated)

If we keep separate tools: 

- make Rdata data types specific (like xmcs https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/xcms/tree/dev/datatypes)
